📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end SQL-based data analysis performed on the Chinook Music Store database.
The objective was to analyze music sales, customer behavior, and geographic performance to generate business insights and strategic recommendations.

Unlike guided exercises, this project was completed in an open-ended manner, requiring independent problem-solving, assumption validation, and iterative query design—closely simulating real-world analytics work.

🧠 Business Objectives

The analysis focuses on answering both objective and subjective business questions, including:

Identifying top-selling tracks, artists, and genres

Analyzing revenue performance across countries, states, and cities

Understanding customer purchasing behavior and churn patterns

Ranking customers and genres by revenue contribution

Deriving insights for marketing, retention, and cross-selling strategies
